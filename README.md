finished tasks.All right let's say we need a full report of our tasks.We can easily do that by clicking

neatly with several columns.We have the Task ID a unique number for each task name of the task a
short summary of what needs to be done priority whether the task is low medium or high priority,
status so we know if it's pending in progress or done due date the deadline for completing the task,

Update Task page.From here we can modify the title description priority due date or or even reassign
the task to different team members.The assigned members are displayed in an avatar group and we can
update them the same way we did when creating the task.If we decide that this task is no longer needed
we can delete it by clicking on the Delete button.But don't worry it won't just disappear instantly.

account and sign in as a team member to see what their dashboard looks like.All right now that we're logged in
as a team member we have landed on the Team Member Dashboard. It looks pretty 
similar to the Admin dashboard but the key difference is that this one only shows the tasks assigned to 
this specific user.At the top we can see a quick task summary showing how many tasks are pending in progress 
and completed.Below that there are visual charts that break down the task distribution and priority levels making
it easy to track workload at a glance.At the bottom of the page we have the Recent Tasks section showing a 
table with the latest tasks.Now let's head over to the My Tasks section to check out the full list of assigned

team members assigned to it.For tasks that are in progress we can see a progress bar that indicates how much work has been 
completed.If a task is pending or completed it's clearly labeled so the team member knows what needs attention.
